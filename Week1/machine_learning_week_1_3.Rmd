This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r warning=TRUE}
p1 = 0.5
p2 = 0.9
p3 = 0.99
n = 10
n2 = 100
n3 = 1000

n1p1 = rbinom(10000, n1, p1)
n1p2 = rbinom(10000, n1, p2)
n1p3 = rbinom(10000, n1, p3)

n2p1 = rbinom(10000, n2, p1)
n2p2 = rbinom(10000, n2, p2)
n2p3 = rbinom(10000, n2, p3)

n3p1 = rbinom(10000, n3, p1)
n3p2 = rbinom(10000, n3, p2)
n3p3 = rbinom(10000, n3, p3)
```

```{r warning=TRUE}
count = 0
for (x in n1p1) {
  if (x>5 & x<10) {
    count = count+1
  }
}


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
